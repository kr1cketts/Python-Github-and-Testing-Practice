# Python-Github-and-Testing-Practice
Adding and testing changes to an old programming project.
I am going to change a lot. I plan on changing the code such that it acts as a normal calculator. Instead of asking what function they wish to perform, the user will simply input the problem and the code will answer it as a normal calculator. 
I still want to keep jokes, maybe add some more?
Get rid of the 'whats the magic word?' bc its kind of annoying
