# Python-Github-and-Testing-Practice
Adding and testing changes to an old programming project.

# Start
Firstly, I am going to fix the bug that occurs when you attempt to divide any number by 0 and print that the output is undefined. 
Next, I am going to add another function for squareroots! Only one number will need to be inputted and the outcome will be its squareroot! Maybe I can have two inputs, such that the first number is the number being squarerooted, but the second number needs to be above 1 but if its 2, the function will find its squareroot and if the second input is 3, then the function will find the integer's cuberoot, and so on. 
Finally, I'm going to get rid of the 'whats the magic word?' bc its kind of annoying

It was quite easy to add the error handling when the num2 for division was 0! All i did was use an if an if statement and printed to the user that the answer was undefined.
